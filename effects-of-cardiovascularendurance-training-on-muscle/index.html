<p>The clinical effects of endurance exercise training on coronary endothelial function were first studied in humans by Hambrecht et al 117. The effect of concurrent training on muscle strength has been relatively well documented but less is known about the long-term effects of such training on muscle growth fiber composition capillary density and oxidative capacity. This improves muscle circulation.</p>

<p>Cardiovascular endurance can be improved by doing several types of aerobic conditioning. According to these authors studies using various experimental protocols have shown that concurrent strength and endurance training resulted in compromised strength gains hennessey and watson 1994 hickson 1980 or uncompromised strength gains hunter et al 1987 mccarthy et al 1995 while no decrease in endurance capacity was observed.

The physiological adaptations associated with these improvements in both maximal exercise performance as reflected by increases in maximal oxygen uptake VO2max and submaximal exercise endurance include increases in both cardiovascular function and skeletal muscle oxidative capacity. These authors found a statistically significant improvement for both muscular strength and cardiovascular endurance when the circuit training was complemented with endurance training. Intense endurance exercise causes mild epithelial injury and inflammation in the airways but does not. Pin On Muscle Building Workout Plan.</p>
