<p>Personally I think training a muscle 3x a week is to much but you can do whatever you will. You can do two body parts together but the movement of the body parts should not be different. Cheat days or refeed days can have both positive and negative effects on the human mind. If you want to gain size you should not train it every day the chest will not have time to repair the damage you do to it. If you do pullups and dips on separate days you could do them almost daily.
