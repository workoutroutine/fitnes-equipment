<p>The problem is hardly anyone actually does them this way. A hip thrust is started in a glute bridge and the hips drop to almost touch the ground then thrust back to a hip bridge position. I am really loving how the hip thrust has become a staple lift in the gym. Gently place a dumbbell or weighted plate to rest on your hip bones during the thrust. This occurs when you lift the heaviest weight possible that allows you to 1 keep the spine in neutral 2 achieve full hip extension and 3 hold the lockout for a second using the glutes as the primary driver.
