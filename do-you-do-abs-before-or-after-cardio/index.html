You dont need to and shouldnt do abs for hours before your cardio. And some say if we are going to do them on the same day we should start with cardio before abs.

<p>Many peoples have a question when should u do abs workout and cardio. Performing classic ab moves like crunches and situps at the end of your workout is an exercise in futility. Targeting abs directly can make you look bigger if you have fat in the ab area so the best thing is to indirectly train them but once in a while is okay but to answer your question you should do it after because your abs stabilize while doing cardio and the fat is utilized and you can do a set or two after the workout as a finisher.
