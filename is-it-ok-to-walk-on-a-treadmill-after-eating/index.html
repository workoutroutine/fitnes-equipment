<p>My personal recommendations for my patients is to slowly resume physical exercise starting with walking treadmill or pavement increasing amounts at three weeks. For some this means walking too close to the front end of the treadmill and shrinking your stride. Youre supposed to look in front of you not down. There is a notion that strolling simply after a meal reasons fatigue belly ache and other types of discomfort. At that point food has digested enough to avoid stomach upset.

Generally speaking exercise at any time is a good thing. What Are The Benefits Of Walking After Dinner Benefits Of Walking Dinner Help Stomach Problems.</p>
