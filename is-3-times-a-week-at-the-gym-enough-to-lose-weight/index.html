<p>Or if Im not wrong you would have heard this from a trainer or friend that full body workout is more effective than hitting a single body part a day. As long as you do at least 3 times a week in the gym youre good. It also depends on what you do. You could work out hard all week but you could destroy all the work in one cheat day. Most importantly of all though the routine you choose will need to be one that suits your lifestyle and therefore one that you can keep up. Pin On Schadule.</p>

<p>It also depends on what you do. Take a look and why not try it for yourself. For example I exercise 6 days a week. Not only does it help to keep you fit and healthy it also boosts the number of calories you expend each day too. Many people choose to workout more than the minimum recommended number of days but busy people should not feel guilty for exercising only three days a week.
