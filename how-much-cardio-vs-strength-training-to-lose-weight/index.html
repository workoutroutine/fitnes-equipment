Strength training or weight training is an anaerobic activity that includes lifting free weights such as bench presses dumbbells and kettlebells. Strength training is much better for general fitness health and weight loss than most people realize and specifically it can partially replace so-called cardio workouts which are highly repetitive and time-consuming and are a risk for all of the common repetitive strain injuries RSIs like iliotibial band syndrome plantar fasciitis shin splints and several more.

<p>Right off the bat the instantaneous calorie burn from running is greater than that of weight training. Weight training intensity basically refers to how much weight you will be lifting and how heavy or light that weight is for you on a given exercise. The heavier the weightharder it is for you the higher the intensity. When cutting weight its important that you use strength training sessions to preserve muscle mass. Strength training sometimes called resistance or power training builds up muscles with repetitive motion using resistance from free weights weight machines elastic bands or your own body weight.
