Although these pooled data suggest that maximal gains in aerobic power are elicited with intensities between 90 to 100 VO2max 4 times per week with exercise durations of 35 to 45 minutes it is important to note that lower intensities still produce effective changes and reduce the risks of injury in non-athletic groups.</p>
