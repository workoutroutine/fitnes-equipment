Planet Fitness has a LUNK Alarm where if someone drops weights grunts are flexing their muscles in the mirror etc a loud siren wails and red lights around the gym begin flashing. The alarm also alerts gym managers to the lunk. 99 of the weight lifting population does not do dead-lifts correctly. Pin On Biceps Triceps.</p>

<p>Why cant you deadlift at planet fitness. Someone in private pointed out that the deadlift is banned there likely because that type of clientele would be injured by deadlifts and then sue the gym. The alarm also alerts gym managers to the lunk. So other than a diving one of my biggest lifetime passions is fitness. Did you know they removed their squat racks. Pin On Gym.</p>

<p>You cant drop your weights or grunt. At one point though you may be hitting 15 reps of some exercise with the 60s which means you probably should have gone up in weight a while ago. Originally started in 1992 as a small operation in New Hampshire Planet Fitness is now the fastest-growing gym chain in the United States with over 750 locations nationwide. If you are and youre mad just leave. Thats why they have the lunk alarm a safety and warning system thats activated. Pin On Fitness Inspiration.</p>
