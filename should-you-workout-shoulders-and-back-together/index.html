<p>Your hands should be around shoulder-width apart. Try hammering one major muscle group chest legs and back per workout and supplement this work by splitting the rest of your session into moves that target two smaller muscle groups biceps. For Biceps they can be done with Triceps or chest as you wish. You can do that and then hit arms again with shoulders blasting arms twice-a-week. You could train back with shoulders.

<p>If you train arms 6 days per week youll do one exercise per muscle group per day with only 2 sets per workout. Shoulders should always be done along with Back workouts because they compliment each other and most exercises of back involve shoulders also. If you train arms 6 days per week youll do one exercise per muscle group per day with only 2 sets per workout. Your back should remain straight throughout the exercises. So if you want to hit your rear delts hard consider separating your back and shoulder workouts by at least 48 hours. Pin On Workout.</p>
