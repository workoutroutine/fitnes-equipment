<p>Thats the perfect time to start 4 weeks training the Glutes 6 times per week then go back to a reduced frequency. 4 times a week 3 sets each workouts 6-10 reps. The amount you do depends on your preference and the time you have and it will determine how much volume and intensity you put into each session. In fact training each muscle 2 or 3 times per week resulted in 31 greater muscle growth than training each muscle just once per week. When does it become overtraining.

<p>How many times a week should I do legs to gain muscle. I know many do two-three days for the upper body. Training 3 days per week Three workouts a week is a common go-to for beginners and those looking to get lean but works great for muscle gains as well as it provides more exposure to a training stimulus than most. CONCLUSION Although some studies have shown that training should be performed three four or even five times per week this study suggests that over time the differences in strength gains between low- and high-frequency training get smaller and smaller.
