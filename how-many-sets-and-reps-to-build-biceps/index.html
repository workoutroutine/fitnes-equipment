<p>Make sure you give your biceps or any muscle groups really enough rest time to recover between sets and between workouts during your week. This works for most exercises youll do - biceps curls included. Additionally you want to focus on a load of 67 or less of your one-rep max 1RM. To progressively build muscle mass gradually increase stress to your biceps by adding more weight reps or sets. If you want to get stronger biceps you need to perform sets and repetitions that will cause you to challenge your muscles and lift heavier and heavier weight.

<p>They say that a single set of 12 reps could be just as effective in building muscle as three sets using heavier weight. Train like a bodybuilder. If youre looking to maximize muscle size target 8-12 reps per set on average and choose multijoint movements like the bench press squat overhead press bent-over row and deadlift which recruit more total muscle mass than single-joint moves thus allowing you to lift heavier weights. More specifically the National Strength and Conditioning Association NSCA recommends executing more than 12 reps and having a rest interval in-between sets of 30-seconds or less for muscular endurance.

<p>Each workout can consist of a total of around 15-25 sets but the number of sets for a specific muscle group in that workout should be at around 10. Rest periods are short and last 30 seconds or less. This is the range that stimulates the most muscle growth. Anita Bean the author of The Complete Guide to Strength Training recommends performing six to 12 repetitions in two to three sets.
