<p>Wake Up with Cardio to Lose Weight Getty Images Cardio-specifically high intensity interval training HIIT-may be better to do in the morning so that you can enjoy the afterburn in which your metabolism is working on overdrive through out the day says Sieben referring to EPOC or excess postexercise oxygen consumption. Wake Up with Cardio to Lose Weight Getty Images Cardio-specifically high intensity interval training HIIT-may be better to do in the morning so that you can enjoy the afterburn in which your metabolism is working on overdrive through out the day says Sieben referring to EPOC or excess postexercise oxygen consumption. If you prefer cardio after you are done with strength training I personally prefer this then train cardio after weight training. Your heart and muscles are already warmer and more prepared for exercise than they are in the morning. Its not a bad idea.

<p>Your first priority in the morning after fasting all night during sleep should be to feed the body protein and carbs thus restoring the body to an anabolic state once again. If you want to do cardio in addition to your weight training I would recommend 3x full body weight training incl legs and 2x cardio low intensity per week. I want to change my routine to try to see some more fat loss results. Keep Them Separate. Weight training on Mo We Fri and cardio either immediately afterwards or on two of the four remaining days.

<p>All my cardio is fasted ie. A Word From Verywell Ultimately you should exercise at whatever time you feel most comfortable with and can manage while also considering all personal factors. I am thinking of doing cardio immediately after I wake up before meal for 30-45 minutes then eat breakfast after cardio. Your sugar insulin and hormone levels may drop to a degree where you feel discomfort. Cardio at night still burns calories and may just feel easier.
