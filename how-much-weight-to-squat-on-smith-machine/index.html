<p>If youre looking to squat in a rack you need to use a standard Olympic size barbell. In some cases the Smith machine itself has a counterweight that reduces the weight of the bar and often there is no way to know by how much.

Figuring out the true Smith machine to free weight conversion is hard at the best of times but its near impossible when your Smith machine doesnt list its actual bar weight which in my experience can be anywhere from 3kg-25kg. I just see the Smith as more like a supported thing I believe long term if I follow my dream of wanting to compete that the smith machine would help keep a narrow waist due to not using the obliques as much.
