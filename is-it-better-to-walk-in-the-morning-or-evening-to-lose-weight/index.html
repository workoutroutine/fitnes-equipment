<p>Jen could start by eating a banana earlier in the morning she said. Eat more carbs in. Start by extending your morning and evening walks by a few blocks increasing pace and distance as you both become more fit. A morning sweat may also lead to better mental health and productivity throughout the day since exercise is great for reducing stress. Walking for 30 minutes a day or more on most days of the week is a great way to improve or maintain your overall health. Pin On Exercises.</p>
