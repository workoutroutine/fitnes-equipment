<p>If you want to gain a lot of lean muscle mass you can do so it with just dumbbells. Id keep doing compound movements. You can do it with light to medium dumbbells.</p>
<h3 id="whenever-you-lift-weights-in-this-matter-the-only-thing-that-happens-is-that-your-muscles-get-a-really-good-pump">Whenever you lift weights in this matter the only thing that happens is that your muscles get a really good pump.</h3><p>This is probably why lighter weights and heavier weights leads to equivalent muscle growth when equated for volume. Thats why any good bodybuilder whos been at it more than eight or nine years lifts less weight than he used to not more. You can even gain muscle without going to the gym or needing a lot of workout space. For example if you are doing shoulder exercises that focus on the rotator cuff you have to use lighter weights. You can do tons of volume using lower weights.</p>
