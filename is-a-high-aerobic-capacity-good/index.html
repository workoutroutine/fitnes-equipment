<p>Your aerobic capacity as measured with a VO 2 max test is the maximal amount of oxygen your body can consume during maximal intensity exerciseIt is the product of your maximal cardiac output and your arterial-venous oxygen difference. Your V02 max is the volume of oxygen your body uses in a given amount of time. Anaerobic Threshold Concept Individuals endowed with the possibility to obtain a high oxygen uptake need to complement with rigorous training program in order to achieve maximal performance. Activity and varied leisure time pursuits eg gardening of moderate intensity can. How can I increase my aerobic capacity.

<p>For instance aerobic capacity is an important factor and is defined as the maximal oxygen intake in liters per minute for an athlete. A higher AT allows you to train at higher intensity without lactate building up in practice this means you can keep going at a higher intensity for a longer time. Increasing aerobic capacity can help improve the flow of oxygenated blood to muscle tissue which in turn can improve mitochondrial density. A high aerobic capacity is an equivalent of being in good cardiovascular shape. Activity and varied leisure time pursuits eg gardening of moderate intensity can.
