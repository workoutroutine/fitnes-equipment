<h3 id="but-we-do-not-want-you-to-let-it-ruin-your-entire-week-of-workouts">But we do not want you to let it ruin your entire week of workouts.</h3><p>Although if you are asking this question you should be only going 4 times a week for an hour each time. It depends on what youre doing of course but there are some programs that have you training twice a day the only one I can think of is this horrible website though. But we do not want you to let it ruin your entire week of workouts. Of course for anyone currently not getting enough exercise taking up any new regime will have a beneficial effect alongside a healthy diet. You could throw something in on the last day if you wanted to go 7 full days a week but I prefer a rest day since I still do a good amount of heavy lifts.</p>
