<p>Harder to max out bench on a smith machine then a regular bench. While some people can often lift more on the Smith machine when benching there are other reasons that this does not carry over to your free-weight bench press. This makes it easier to learn the proper form and also enables you to lift safely without a spotter. The good thing about the Smith machine is that the track can often dull the downward momentum. Admittedly it can make for dangerous and unnatural squatting and pressing but with just a few tweaks it can also be an excellent hypertrophy tool while providing a nice change of pace from the usual routine.
