<p>If we put enough mechanical tension on our muscles they will grow. Including ankle stretching and strengthening in your daily routine pays off in accident prevention and better mobility. Basic lifting movements will form the basis of your workout routine. However too much of a good thing can be bad and in this case relying on temporary added resistance and strength isnt going to give you any good and long lasting results. There are many reasons why you might wish to incorporate ankle weights into your workout routine. .</p>
