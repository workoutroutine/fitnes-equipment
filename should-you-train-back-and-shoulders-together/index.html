<p>Which Muscle Group to Workout with Chest. So can you work out shoulders and back together. Just wonder if anyone has had success training Shoulders and Back on the same day.</p>
<h3 id="the-shoulder-is-quite-sensitive-to-injury-because-of-fine-muscle-padding-as-i-have-not-build-enough-cushion-and-afraid-to-over-work-it">The shoulder is quite sensitive to injury because of fine muscle padding as I have not build enough cushion and afraid to over-work it.</h3><p>Abs calves biceps and triceps can be trained with 6-8 sets. There is no muscle-building advantage its not as much fun and you get no additional cardio benefit. The frontal deltoids are directly involved in bench pressing movements consequently it was be easy to over train them if you worked shoulders on the same day. Plus when it comes to the function of the back muscles the traps upper mid and lower are heavily involved and I would even venture to say that they are used more in back training movements than in shoulder exercises. Maybe for those people who have been training for years both shoulder and back can handle enough stress to combine both on the same day.</p>
