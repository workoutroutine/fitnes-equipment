<p>You can definitely train chest and shoulder muscles after back and bicep day. Can I Do Chest After Shoulder Day. This is known as an UpperLower Split since you dont just train your chest and shoulders on the same day you train your entire upper body one day your legs the other.

<p>Why it Works Think about it. Yes you can train your chest and triceps together.
