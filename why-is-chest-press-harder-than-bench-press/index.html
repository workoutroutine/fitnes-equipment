Everything being equal dumbbell incline bench press is the hardest with the steeper the angle the harder the lift because as you increase the angle from 180 degrees laying down to 90 degrees sitting up the movement requires more recruitment of your smaller weaker shoulder muscles and less recruitment of you larger stronger pec muscles. In the floor press the arms rest on the ground at the bottom of the movement thus removing tension and elastic energy from your muscles. There are studies that show that if you predominantly lift on the machines you will gain more strength on the machine than on free weights. Because with no barbell to balance you are free to focus on pushing your muscles to failure.</p>
