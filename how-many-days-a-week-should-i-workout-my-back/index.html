<p>4 to 5 days per week of strength training an advanced exerciser might structure their week with three days on one day off. And since you will only be working out once a week you will need to use bigger weights and have more reps and sets. Even if you use an elaborate body-part split that keeps you from training your muscles two days in a row you still need to watch out for fatigue especially in the areas being worked every day such as your spinal erectors.
