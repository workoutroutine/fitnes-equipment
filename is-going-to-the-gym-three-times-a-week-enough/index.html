<p>Contrary to popular belief it doesnt actually take much time to gain strength. It was weird. 1-2 times per week to maintain 3 to make progress. But after a year of training you should eventually be training at least 3-4x a week. I am still chubby but i feel healthy.

<p>So 3 days a week for lifting is definitely enough. Is working out 3 times a week enough to lose fat. Three times a week is definitely enough for you to achieve strength training goals. Yes 3 times a week are enough to get big but it will take longer than say 4 or 6 times. I did almost exclusively just the big three - squats dead lift and bench press.
