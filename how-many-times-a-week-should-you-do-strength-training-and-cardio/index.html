<p>While strength training or muscle strength should be done as much as 2-3 days per week. Lets define these terms a bit as people toss them around without much understanding. But if youre really looking to change your body composition you can work out five times a week and incorporate two to three days of cardio-specific training into the mix. And stay away from lengthy low-intensity exercises. You should perform one set of eight to 12 repetitions two times a week if youre just beginning. Pin On Fitness.</p>

<p>To keep your muscle mass limit your cardio workouts to three to four times per week at 30 to 40 minutes each. If your main goal is to lose fat a better approach would be to emphasize the cardio and burn much more energy by taking the cardio up to an hour four days per week and doing full body strength training two days per week and maybe even have those followed by a couple of shorter 2030 minute cardio sessions right after the strength work. But if youre really looking to change your body composition you can work out five times a week and incorporate two to three days of cardio-specific training into the mix. Stick to two to three days of cardio per week. Hard-training people with more muscle take longer to recover than less muscular people. Pin On Fitness.</p>
