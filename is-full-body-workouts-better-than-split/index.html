<p>On other days i do HIIT. I think splits are better. Studies consistently show that full body routines cause better fat loss often double or more of that of a split routine.

<p>Cole 08102018 As with most debates within the strength and conditioning industry theres no right answer to the question of whether full body workouts or body part split workouts are better says says Mike Krajewski PT CSCS owner of MK Fitness in Nashville TN.

Because there are so many different ways to set up a split routine its impossible to say that a full body workout is better than a split routine or vice versa. This video from Dr Mike Israetel explains the benefits of full body workouts against body-part split training.
