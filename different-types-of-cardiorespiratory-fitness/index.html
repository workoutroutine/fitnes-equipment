<p>The research published in the scientific journal European Heart Journal analyzed cardiorespiratory fitness that is the ability of the heart and lungs to supply oxygen to the bodys muscles during physical activity in 2070 participants of the Framingham Heart Study a long-term multigenerational study designed to identify factors that contribute to cardiovascular. Physical activity is a behavior and CRF is an attribute. Cardiorespiratory fitness was measured as absolute power output in watts in a maximal progressive cycle ergometer test. BOSTON We all know that exercise is good for us and that being fit can lower our risk of heart disease and possibly help us to live longer but what amount and type of physical activity can. In this analysis investigators found that people who increased their steps per day participated in a greater amount of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity or reduced their sedentary time between the two exams showed improvements in distinct aspects of cardiorespiratory fitness throughout exercise sessions from warm-up to peak exercise to.
