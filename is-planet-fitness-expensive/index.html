But the Planet Fitness reviews say that the club. Planet fitness is fine for cardio and some lifting but if you are trying to bulk up a lot and plan on doing squats deadlifts and those types of things its probably not the place to go. The membership cost for the classic membership is just 10 per month. That kills it for me. Planet Fitness Membership Review Is It Worth It.</p>

<p>But for weight training Planet Fitness is useless. In my mind places like Planet Fitness are great for people that want to work out but not that hard. Planet Fitness enrollment fees vary with many privately owned franchises charging a 100 enrollment fee or. Startup fees also vary greatly but can be between 1 and 3900. Most of the centres dont even ask for any long term commitment. Is It Time To Buy Planet Fitness The Motley Fool.</p>
