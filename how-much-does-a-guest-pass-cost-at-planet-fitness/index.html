<p>Former Member Services Representative at Planet Fitness 2018-2019 Answered 2 years ago As a regular member you arent given a guest pass so youd have to pay the day fee which is 20. Members are allowed to bring a guest but this is not a reliable way to work out as their is a limit of how many times per month they can bring the guest. With our other membership types members can bring a guest subject to the daily rate which is 20 and can be applied towards their membership if they join within 30 days. The cost of a Planet Fitness membership is going to depend on how long you are going to commit. Planet Fitness runs promotions frequently throughout the year where you can sign up for a Classic plan with a 1 enrollment fee.
