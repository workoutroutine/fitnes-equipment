<p>I was excited to get a Golds Gym membership from the days of watching Arnold train in a Golds I thought Im heading in the right direction but two weeks into it Im having a difference in opinion. In 1998 it was acquired by Flexible Flyer. We just watched an auction and Cybex VR2 was going for 1200 1400 a piece. In 2006 it was acquired by Nautilus Inc. But giving excellent touch-up works and getting it ready to look as good as new should work advantageous for these smaller gyms. Pin On 1800 S.</p>
