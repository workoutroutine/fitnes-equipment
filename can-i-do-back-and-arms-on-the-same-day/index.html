<p>I cant focus on doing biceps cause im using lots of strength on back. Anyone have experience with both obviously you would pre exhaust your biceps and triceps but this could lead to less secondary muscle involvement but possibly not getting the most out of the arm muscles. Your arms are made up of biceps two heads and triceps three heads with Triceps being the bigger muscle. If Im doing a high interval cardio and lifting arms in the same day which is better to do first for optimal results or does it matter. However one could argue in favor of doing arms on leg day but because your arms will not be pre-fatigued from doing other primary muscle exercises. 3 Simple Workouts You Can Do At Home In Less Than 15 Minutes Easy Workouts At Home Workouts Workout Routine.</p>

<p>Many advanced weight training programs do just this. If arms are important to you then working them twice a week is ok but always start each workout with your heavy compound lifts like squats rows benchpress etc and use isolation work like curls to finish. So i think i wanna separate biceps on its own day and do back and shoulders on the same day. You can do chest and triceps on the same day as they work in a similar movement. Again this is just an example. Day 2 Shoulders Arms And Abs Shoulder And Arm Workout Barbell Workout Abs Workout Gym.</p>
