<p>This can all be fixed however and it can be done with lighter weights than usual. I get questions all the time about why I use such little weight. I also discovered that i piled on more muscle than i did using heavy weights to exhaustion. You can certainly build muscle in this rep range. Throw in the fact that the exercise itself limits the actions of the chest because of the tendency to push the weights straight up and avoid the all important horizontal adduction of the shoulder that allows the chest to contribute more.
