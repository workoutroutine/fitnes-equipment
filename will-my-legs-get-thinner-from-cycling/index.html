<p>For me personally when I do weights and HIIT my arms and stomach tend to slim down but my legs get too muscular for my liking. While I have and wear slightly heavier bib shorts or bib tights when temps get below 50F10C lighter weight summer bibs on scorching hot days and racing ones with smaller thinner pads on 1hr interval training rides Ill almost always wear the kind of cycling bib shorts Ive reviewed below for the late spring summer and early fall rides of over 40 miles65km long. Our bike experts found the best cycling bibs of 2021 including top bike shorts from Rapha Pearl Izumi Velocio and more. I cant choose exactly where the fat comes off from my legs. These 14 pairs of cycling shorts for men from brands like Pearl Azumi Louis Garneau and others will help you to stay comfortable on long bike rides. Will My Legs Get Bigger Before Getting Smaller Rachael Attard.</p>
