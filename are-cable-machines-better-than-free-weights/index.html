<p><strong>Are Cable Machines Better Than Free Weights</strong>, Free weights are better than machine weights almost every time. Certain cable machines can be considered free weights since the resistance is not set on a fixed path of motion rather it can be moved in 3-dimensional space. Like free weights you can still perform a fairly wide range of exercises on a cable machine.</p>

<p>For sure machines let you put up more weight and lift heavier than free weights. In my neighborhood there are few commercial gyms. Dont be afraid to use some fixed machines they can offer you a much more consistent resistance throughout a larger portion of the range of motion.</p>
<h3 id="free-weights-require-more-skill-and-activate-more-connecting-muscles-than-do-machines">Free weights require more skill and activate more connecting muscles than do machines.</h3><p>Its fair to say these important exercises are not suitably performed using a cable system. For the average person free weights offer many of the same benefits as machines plus some. You have constant tension on the muscles which doesnt always happen with certain freeweight exercises. Free weights let me also add that machines can be invaluable if you have a training injury and wish to lock yourself into a plane of motion on a particular exercise to avoid undue stress on an injured area.
