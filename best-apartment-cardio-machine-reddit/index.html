<p>The best cardio machine for a small space is going to be something that is lightweight compact and folds. I also think the c2 rower was a blessing and a necessity since my previous homegym was tiny18mx3m. I think a rowing machine is one of the best pieces of cardio equipment you can buy. If I had the space and cash I would but a Concept 2 rower. However getting those endorphins pumping is more important than ever.

<p>I am 34 years old male 58 and about 145 lb. For exercise bikes you could try the Marcy Foldable Exercise Bike or Exerpeutic Folding Magnetic Upright Bike. The NordicTrack C700 Treadmill is our top pick for the Best Cardio Equipment for Small Spaces however that doesnt necessarily mean its best for you. I have in mind some kind of stationary bike possibly a rower but Im open to other options. A little about us. Weight Rack And Bench Homemade Gym Equipment Home Made Gym Diy Home Gym.</p>
