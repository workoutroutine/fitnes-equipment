<p>To build muscle you must push your muscles to the limit then let them recover and grow stronger as they do. You can find weight-gain diets that suggest you eat 2-3 grams of protein per pound of body weight or even more but registered dietician Doug Kalman PhD says beyond a certain point all that extra protein may not do much to increase muscle mass. You will lose weight BY strength training and keep the muscle you have. In a sense its the minimum amount you need to keep from getting sick not the specific amount you are supposed to eat every day.
