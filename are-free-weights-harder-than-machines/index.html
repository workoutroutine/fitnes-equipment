<p>If we look at EMG research we see that muscle activation tends to be higher with free weights than with exercise machines. The main muscles engaged are the quadriceps and the hamstrings and calves to a degree. You simply press it up and lower it back down. For example a study by Schick et al found that the barbell bench press was better at activating our shoulders than the Smith Machine bench press. With machines on the other hand joint stress is highly reduced because motion is restricted meaning under most circumstances you can safely train a target muscle with less irritation. 6 Gym Machines You Shouldn T Skip Over Men S Journal.</p>
