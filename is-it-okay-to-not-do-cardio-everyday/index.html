<p>In fact the number one killer of American is heart disease. If youre looking to build strength and put on muscle mass research suggests you are best to keep your weights separate from your cardio work. For those looking to lose weight especially substantial weight you should engage in cardio exercises roughly five days a week. This gives you at least two days to rest and recover. The calories you would burn in a 24hr period if you just lay down and didnt move all day.

<p>If you were to do 60-minutes of brisk walking on the treadmill per day that would equate to roughly 360 to 528 calories burned. While the foundation of HIIT is cardio tapping into your fast-twitch muscle fibers also encourages muscle growth and strength Cornick says giving you both cardio and strength benefits. Yeah cardio doesnt work. The good news is that doing 30 minutes of cardio daily can boost your mood as noted by certified nutritionist Katie Boyd. If you have trouble completing your normal exercise sessions feel compelled to do cardio activity every day despite sluggish feelings and are losing strength despite continued efforts at the gym.

<p>Thats because daily cardio is not only boring which makes it. So anyone telling you cardio is pointless is flat out an idiot. Nothing wrong with cardio every day but definitely ease into it and take a rest day if your body is telling you to. If you do cardio at night and dont eat after your workout then you will have a much better chance of tapping into your fat stores if your overall calorie and carbohydrate intake is not too high. What you should do is different intensities and durations and possibly modalities alternating longer workouts one day with shorter workouts the next day.
