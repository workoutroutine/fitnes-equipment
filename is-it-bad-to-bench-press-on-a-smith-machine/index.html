<h3 id="plus-dumbells-are-a-better-workout-that-just-doing-regular-bench-because-you-end-up-using-yoru-stabilizer-muscles-as-someone-said-above">Plus dumbells are a better workout that just doing regular bench because you end up using yoru stabilizer muscles as someone said above.</h3><p>The good thing about the Smith machine is that the track can often dull the downward momentum. Many Smith machines reduce the bars weight by 10 15 or 20 pounds. An increase in shearing force on your spine particularly the L4-L5 vertebral joint puts you at extreme risk of injury. I have lifted for over 52 years. While a regular bench press has safety as its number one concern the Smith machine bench press puts safety first.</p>
