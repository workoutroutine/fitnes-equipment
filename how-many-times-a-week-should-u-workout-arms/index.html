<p>I was just wondering if you could please direct me to a suitable workout plan. I usually eat 5 times a day. At times Ive been over the 100 reps mark and my all-time best was 110 push ups in 2 minutes back when I was in the US. Or maybe generally speaking stretcher exercises seem to be good when one trains the glutes only 2 times per week while activators seem better for hitting the glutes 3-4 times a week and pumpers 5-6 times a week but it seems to me that that there might be over. I usually do 45 min cardio and abs exercises and burn between 1600- 1800 calories 3 times a week and weights 1-2 times a week.
