<p>ACE also suggests incorporating two activities into one cross-training session to boost weight loss. Higher-burn exercises should lead to faster fat-loss results than those that. A fast walking speed of 65 kmh 4 mph burns 352 kcal per hour while a fast cycling speed of 30 kmh 19 mph burns 844 kcal per hour. That is because with walking you burn half as many calories as youd do when cyclingAlso riding a bike will challenge you to go on hilly terrain which burns more calories than walkingIt is safe to say cycling is a much better way of losing weight faster unlike walking which burns lower calories. Although cycling has the potential for a greater calorie burn if you never feel confident enough on your bike to go faster than 10 mph you may be better off race-walking to burn more calories to lose weight.
