<p>One of the big keys to sustaining high power on the bike is generating the force with your glutes and not your quads. Heres what Hunter Allen cycling coach and co-author of Training and Racing with a Power Meter has to say.

Keeping them strong and firing is the key to being strong in race winning efforts.

<p>The best cyclists use both their quads and glutes or butt muscles to provide power with each pedal stroke. Answer 1 of 4. Roll that pelvis forward and engage the glutes. Huge power can be generated by the glutes. Off-season weight room workouts are needed to strengthen this forsaken muscle group when cycling.
