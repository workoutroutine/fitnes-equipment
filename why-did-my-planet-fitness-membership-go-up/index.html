<p>I have only been a member for a month and a half and they refuse to give me a refund. Items marked with a are available at participating locations only. Planet Fitness memberships are always 10 a month or 1999 a month for the PF Black Card. Then today I hear prices are going up. My new roommates are both very fit dudes who work out regularly.

While most gyms target body builders or those who want to become stronger Planet Fitness began with a quest to target. Once everything is back to normal I might re-join.
