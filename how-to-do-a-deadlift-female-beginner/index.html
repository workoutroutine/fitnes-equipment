<p>I used to deadlift regularly myself and could do like 25x or so and would deadlift 2x a week. And do not rest between arms. If you cant do 10 sets of 10 reps with one minute of rest dont reduce the rest each week. Use these cues instead and youll Deadlift with proper form. Perform all workouts at a BEGINNER LEVEL and advance ONLY when YOU ARE READY.
