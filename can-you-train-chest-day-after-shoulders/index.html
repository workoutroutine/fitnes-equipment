<h3 id="you-can-do-it-is-your-shoulders-arent-to-sore-but-a-lot-of-chest-workouts-incorporate-shoulder-muscles">You can do it is your shoulders arent to sore but a lot of chest workouts incorporate shoulder muscles.</h3><p>This means that if you train shoulders after chest day not your shoulder AND your chest will be fatigued. When the chest and shoulders catch up Ill change up the routine. Overworking these muscles may lead to longer rest periods thanks to muscle strain which can effectively undo any progress youve done at the gym. So that is day 1 and day 2 out of the way next you dont have a have a range of choices I suggest that you train legs this is because your chest may still be sore and wouldnt want to train SHOULDERS on a sore CHEST and that your arms need a bit of recovery from the CHEST and BACK workouts.
