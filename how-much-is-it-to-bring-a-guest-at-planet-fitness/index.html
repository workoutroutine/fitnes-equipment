<p>How much does it cost to bring a friend to Planet Fitness. I think while planet fitness has rules regarding this it really depends on the local planet fitness near you. If you dont want to do the trial the day fee is 2000 for the day and if your friend likes it they can get the 20 credited toward the sign up cost or their first month if they join within 30 days. Also Check -YMCA prices and Membership cost Planet fitness Prices and Membership cost. If I had a guest I wanted them to try even though I only spend 10 dollars the manager has always let them stay.
