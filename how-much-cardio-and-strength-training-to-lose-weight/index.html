<p>Add cardio into your strength routine by doing sprints after your warmup before you hit the weights. Hey Im currently stuck in a position for losing weight Ive been doing strength and body weight trainings for a year now and now I am switching to HITT training and 2x Cardio a day and I am losing weight but Im thinking its about time I start getting into a cut position Ive got the muscle and everything but I dont know if I should start while Im at 641kgs please help. Try 5-second sprints with about 30-60 second recovery in between each for 5 rounds.

For example how much weight could you lose if you followed a 1200 calorie women or 1800 calorie men diet plan for two weeks a month or six weeksOr perhaps you are wondering how long it would take to lose 30 lbs on a liquid diet. An exhaustive meta-study concluded in 2017 that high-intensity interval training HIIT and low-intensity steady state LISS are pretty much equally effective over the long term. Pin On Burn Fat.</p>
