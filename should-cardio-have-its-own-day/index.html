<p>Youll be fine doing cardio the same day. So you cannot do the same insane cardio workout everyday of the week. Cardio should begin and end with a warm-up and cool-down of about three to five minutes. Now one has to be mindful. A calorie-deficient low-carbohydrate diet will make running for any length of time difficult. Pin On Fitness.</p>

<p>If you are working out and you feel pain or like you are going to vomit you need to stop. To safely do cardio daily limit yourself to 30 minutes of it a day. My philosophy is that transformation is more than just skin deep because of my own 50-pound weight loss I understand how building your fitness changes you from the inside out and Ive even written a book about it. The higher intensity the more rest time thats required in most cases. Cardio should begin and end with a warm-up and cool-down of about three to five minutes. Pin On Workouts.</p>
