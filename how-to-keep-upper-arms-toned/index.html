<p>If tightening and toning the arms is on your list of summer goals try adding these exercises to your fitness regimen three times a week. For a toned upper body the Turkish Get-Up targets the biceps triceps shoulders and the chest muscles. Keep your arms extended and pull back until your upper body is at 90 degrees with your legs. Keep your spine slightly arched and chest out. Extend your arms one at a time behind you and squeeze your triceps muscle for a moment before returning to starting position.

<p>This is the starting position. Bend elbows keeping your upper arms alongside your body. The key is to keep track of your progress slow down and focus on your breathing and form and aim to do better each day. Fortunately there is hope for women with this aesthetic condition thanks to a number of surgical and non-surgical options as well as creams and lotions on the market today. There is really no such thing as a male or female workout and I promise that if you select an appropriate weight theres a very small likelihood that you wont be very sore after this.
