<p>If youre biking and burning lots of calories and dont replace them then youll lose mass in places including your legs. So I thought I would summarize them all into one big blog post. And a myth is what it is. If you toss in plenty of higher-resistanceanaerobicinterval-type biking and eat enough then good consistent hypertrophy is easily doable. Of course cycling improves your leg muscles but as an aerobic exercise it works your endurance muscle fibers making them more resistant to fatigue while training but not causing them to bulk up.

<p>Thats why track cyclists have to develop extra mass and strength to make up for the unfavorable leverage. Your genessome people like sprinters have more fast-twitch anaerobic muscle fibers which are the ones that really pop giving track racers those Lycra-busting quads. To achieve larger legs you will need a high-protein diet that is as high in as many calories as you intend to lose in your exercise. If you want to get big legs from cycling you need to go for rides over 30km and push hard throughout. In fact since bike riding is considered a cardiovascular or aerobic activity you might actually lose weight or decrease the size of your legs if you burn enough calories. Pin On Murales.</p>

<p>If you toss in plenty of higher-resistanceanaerobicinterval-type biking and eat enough then good consistent hypertrophy is easily doable. You are able to receive nice toned legs or you can build some monster quads. Going up a hill isnt going to make you sore tomorrow even if it hurts at the time. Its a common misconception that cycling will increase the size of your legs. If I havent mentioned an exercise that you are wondering about please leave a comment and Ill be sure to answer and add this to the blog post too. Pin On The Cyclist.</p>
