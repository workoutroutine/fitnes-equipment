<p>I like to do 20-30 minutes of cardio prior to my upper body workouts. Your cardio is ruining muscle-growth. If possible spread them out a few hours and dont expect to train too hard on the cardio your legs probably wont handle it well. When I finish my leg work out it takes me about an hour to get rid of the sea leg feeling they are completely shot. However a light trainer who is not really focused on bulky legs may be able to perform cardiovascular exercises after completing the regular workouts for the leg day.

<p>Try doing 20mins of cardiovascular exercises after a 45 minute hypertrophy session that will strip fat just dont go to hard in cardio after or you will burn muscle as well another good way to strip fat is to go for a 30min power walk when you wake up before eating breakfast. The more blood that I can get cicrulating through the muscle the more white blood cells will be able to repair the muscle.

<p>How do you guys do it. BUT I do leg cardio after a squat day. Try doing 20mins of cardiovascular exercises after a 45 minute hypertrophy session that will strip fat just dont go to hard in cardio after or you will burn muscle as well another good way to strip fat is to go for a 30min power walk when you wake up before eating breakfast. Unfortunately cardio does not count as leg day. 10-02-2006 0809 PM 6 HCS. These Legday Quotes Will Either Make You Laugh Out Loud Or Cry Inside Workout Humor Workout Quotes Funny Leg Day Humor.</p>

The more blood that I can get cicrulating through the muscle the more white blood cells will be able to repair the muscle. I dont go crazy with it but a slow steady speed. Can you train your legs with only bodyweight movements. Whether you are a heavy trainer or a light trainer you can manage some cardio after working out your legs but you must have a timeframe in between to allow the muscles of the legs to rest 5.
