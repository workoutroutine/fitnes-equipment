<p>Rowing is a great way to burn calories and develop a lean muscular physique. Rowing is a fantastic mode of exercise to help achieve weight loss goals. According to the monitor I lose 1300 calories every day and I started a strict diet too. On the other hand a treadmill is the best multitasking cardio machine out there. Not only is it not necessary but more isnt better and you are likely to experience issues jumping in to two a days.
