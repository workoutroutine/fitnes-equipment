<p>Some people never even focus on bicep or tricep specific training and still have massive arms 531 training for example. So if you do that there will be no problem in training those muscles but the story will be different for the quads and arms. Heres the thing though most serious gym-goers dismiss the chest and biceps workout as a bro workout that isnt worth doing theyve got it ingrained in their head that if youre hitting chest and you intend on training another muscle group that workout as well it HAS to be tricepsTriceps are the secondary muscle group when hitting chest so theyve been told it makes sense. Theyre pushing movements so its ideal to pair them in a workout. And thats why today HS bodybuilding Break this myth.

<p>I think that the difference is fairly minimal though. And like they said train this muscle with other big muscles And in this way you can also get better bicep and tricep muscles. You can train your chest and shoulders together as the movement that muscle group used during the exercising is the pressing movements. If you do biceps with the chest then it makes a push and pull combo means you train different movements. Working the triceps and biceps on a day other than chest back day would be better because youd be fresh and not compromised by any fatigue still lingering from the chest andor back workout.

<p>Now its very common train triceps on chest day and biceps at the end of your back workout. This can mean that either you will want to train both the biceps and the triceps on the same day to have the most comprehensive arm pump. So should you train your chest and triceps together. Can I workout chest triceps and biceps on the same day. No chest biceps is not a good combination because chest and biceps both are not hurted at same time because bicepes are using to lift the weightwhen you are both doing same time so you cant do using 100 strength bicepes are hurt so much.
