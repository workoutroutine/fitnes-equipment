<p>What is the primary purpose of cardiovascular endurance. The cardiovascular system delivers oxygen nutrients hormones and other important substances to cells and organs in the body. Cardiovascular endurance is important because it helps to boost the supply of oxygen in the body thus boosting strength.</p>
<h3 id="that-is-during-the-activity-oxygen-is-heavily-involved-in-the-cellular-reactions-that-produce-the-energy-necessary-to-sustain-the-activity">That is during the activity oxygen is heavily involved in the cellular reactions that produce the energy necessary to sustain the activity.</h3><p>Increasing cardiorespiratory endurance improves oxygen uptake in the lungs and heart and can help a person sustain physical activity for longer. VO2 tests are usually done with a clinician or exercise physiologist in a laboratory hospital or clinic. The definition of cardiovascular endurance simply put is the bodys ability to continue exertion while getting energy from the aerobic system used to supply the body with energy. Also called aerobic or endurance exercise cardiovascular exercise is any form of activity that uses aerobic metabolism. This is the system that kicks in third after the phosphogen and the glycogen lactic acid system and so the one that supplies energy to the human circulatory system and the muscles.</p>
