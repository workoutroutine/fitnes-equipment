As such having gear like a bench press squat rack or power rack is intimidating to the typical Planet Fitness member and only encourages lunks to overrun the gym. When a person grunts or drops weights it draws unwanted attention the lunk alarm will sound and the club manager will intervene. See they also have a super cheap membership fee that can only be cancelled in person 10 maybe so they need a HUGE membership base for this model to work. They have a no judgement zone sign and a lunk alarm and its good marketing for who theyre targeting. Lunk Planet Fitness Workout Workout Humor Gym Humor.</p>
