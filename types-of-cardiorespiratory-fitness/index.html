<p>Cardiorespiratory fitness is the ability to perform dynamic moderate- to high-intensity exercise involving large-muscle groups for prolonged periods of time American College of Sports Medicine ACSM 2000. Increasing moderate-to-vigorous physical activity by 17 minutes per day taking an additional 4312 steps per day approximately 54 minutes at 80 steps per minute or reducing 249 minutes of sedentary time per day between the two exams corresponded to a 5 percent higher peak VO 2 or peak oxygen uptake. Cardiorespiratory fitness was directly measured by a treadmill graded exercise test and serves as an objective measurement of cardiorespiratory fitness level. Is the client attempting to enhance peak performance or simply to improve or maintain his or her level of general fitness. Although the benefit of high cardiorespiratory fitness CRF for the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus T2DM is widely accepted whether consistently high CRF is necessary or transiently high CRF is sufficient is unclear.
