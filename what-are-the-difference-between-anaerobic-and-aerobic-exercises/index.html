<p><strong>What Are The Difference Between Anaerobic And Aerobic Exercises</strong>, Improved fitness by increasing both your oxygen intake and heart rate according to the Cleveland ClinicWhen you increase your respiratory rate by moving the large muscles of the body your heart pumps. In this blog post we will be going over the differences between aerobic and anaerobic exercises and their benefits and risks. Aerobic training will typically fall in the range of 60 - 80 of your estimated maximum heart rate and can be done continuously for prolonged periods of time anaerobic training will fall between 80 - 90 of your estimated maximum heart rate.</p>

<p>Anaerobic exercises involve quick bursts of energy and are performed at maximum effort for a short time. In aerobic exercise the muscles have enough oxygen to perform continuously for extended periods. The word aerobic means with oxygen as this kind of exercise is fueled by the oxygen that you get.</p>
<h3 id="aerobic-training-will-typically-fall-in-the-range-of-60---80-of-your-estimated-maximum-heart-rate-and-can-be-done-continuously-for-prolonged-periods-of-time-anaerobic-training-will-fall-between-80---90-of-your-estimated-maximum-heart-rate">Aerobic training will typically fall in the range of 60 - 80 of your estimated maximum heart rate and can be done continuously for prolonged periods of time anaerobic training will fall between 80 - 90 of your estimated maximum heart rate.</h3><p>In aerobic training it comes from oxygen and energy stored in carbs proteins and fats. Aerobic exercise is cardiovascular conditioning that strengthens both your heart and lungs. In order to know which kind of exercise is best for your condition and objectives we recommend you consult a physical activity specialist. Aerobic means with air and refers to the body producing energy with the use of oxygen. The fundamental difference between aerobic and anaerobic respiration is the usage of oxygen in the process of cellular respiration.</p>

<p>For anaerobic exercise the muscles will use stored energy sources to fuel itself rather than oxygen which includes breaking down glucose. The biggest difference between aerobic and anaerobic exercise lies in how the body gets its energy. Aerobic respiration as the name suggests is the process of producing the energy required by cells using oxygen. Anaerobic exercise is well-known for building muscle and aerobic exercise is.
