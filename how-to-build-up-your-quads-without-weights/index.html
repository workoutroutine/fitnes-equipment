<p>Be sure to lift and lower your leg in a slow steady motion. Things to Keep in Mind. Use a yoga block or basketball to prop up your knee. Start with a bench or ledge with a height to your liking Alternate legs by using your right to pull your left up Then use your left leg to pull your right up Finish off with leg sprints 10 times by alternating legs And there you have it. But with countless hours in the gym hammering away at those areas that were developmentally deficient I built a pair of legs absent of any apparent flaws.
