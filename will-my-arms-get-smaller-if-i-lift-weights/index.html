<p>But if you increase the weights and do low reps like 8 10 12 with 30lbs weight on each arm you would gain strength and muscle will grow too. First off if you want big upper arms focus on triceps and make sure you do weighted dips and close gripreverse grip benchpress elbows in and for biceps try close grip chinups and barbell rows with an underhand grip. When you lose weight your body reduces the padding of subcutaneous fat that sits just underneath your skin.

<p>Because body size provides an advantage in lifting heavy weights you might get bigger especially if you support your lifting with extra calories. Although you cant tell your body exactly where or in what order to remove that fat rest assured that as you lose weight over your whole body your arms will slim down too. I would sure like to be able to wear tanks this summer and have my arms look good. Extend arms and. Will my arms get smaller as I lose weight.
