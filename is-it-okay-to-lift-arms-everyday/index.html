<p>Just lift your arms and make them as perpendicular to the ground as you can. My clients were too stuffed to even think about it lol. You can work the same muscle or muscle group on back-to-back training days to stimulate muscle growth. If you do all of these things then. I want to emphasize this for you if youre say adding arm exercises before spring and summer sleeveless season.

<p>If youre more experienced dont go thinking you should lift more. Answered 4 years ago It is entirely possible to lift everyday but always remember that each muscle group needs at least 48h recovery time 72h for quads calves and gluteus muscles. If you do your arms and legs on the same day youll probably need to take a break and do nothing the next day which is less. Of course this is not what all of the training or fitness magazines suggest you do. Now with that in mind you can train everyday. 8 Powerful Muscle Building Gym Training Splits Full Body Workout Routine Workout Splits Fitness Body.</p>
