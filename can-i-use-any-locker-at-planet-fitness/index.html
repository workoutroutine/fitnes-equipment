<p>1 days ago Answered August 29 2021 Author has 54 answers and 11K answer views Planet fitness has showers and lockers in all their locations. After I work out I strip down at my locker and wear a towel and flip flops to the showers and do the same when I return from the showers. In the locker rooms you bring your own locks or you can buy one from the front desk. Theres also an extra long toilet stall with a bench inside it which can serve the same purpose.
