<p>My lower half use to be HUGE but I do tons of lower body exercises with weight and I also always workout on the bike and elliptical with high resistance and it is still shrinking and toning up. The higher the incline the more work shifts from the quads to the glutes. Will it help to reach a thigh gap. It actually can help you slim down lose weight and tone your entire body a win-win-win. Spot reduction is not something your body does. Pin On Gastric.</p>

<p>High-intensity interval training or HIIT kicks your metabolism into gear so its effective for burning calories and slimming your upper body. It actually can help you slim down lose weight and tone your entire body a win-win-win. The higher the incline the more work shifts from the quads to the glutes. I vary my resistance between 7-13 and my thighs have only gotten slimmer. The elliptical and treadmill both rely heavily upon your large lower-body muscles.
