For the best GLUTE activation and mind-muscle connection I recommend performing the lunges after 1 or 2 isolating glute exercises such as abductors and hip thrusts. Another big change has been routine. Lastly you have to EAT to grow. Here S How This Woman Transformed Her Butt In 11 Months.</p>

<p>If you are easily able to do these for tons of reps make sure and pre-exhaust the glutes with some of these other glute exercises first. You have to be patient.
