Test weights like balances and scales are available in various classes of accuracy and priced accordingly. It has a wide range of weights of difference classes and capacities all of which are recertified on a frequent basis. Repeat this for at least five times to ensure that the scale is consistent over several weighing. Larger weights make the tests of the scale go faster.</p>
