<p>Two to three days a week is enough. For expedited results workout given muscle 2 days per week. To get the best results I think you need a good mix of the following. I would advise doing 1 main exercise for the glutes per day. I spend about an hour and. Pin On Workout.</p>

<p>If youre not getting significantly stronger in this time frame I sincerely think you need a trainer to physically check out your execution and nutrition. Your in-between recovery days are very important. It depends on your ability to recover eg. If you are working out 2 days per week give atleast 2 days rest between workouts. The experienced athletes carry out leg workouts about two or three times a week. Pin On Fitness.</p>

<p>Yes two to three times a week is enough. Grow your glutes series ep7 alll about training frequency. Every rep that you perform you should FEEL the engagement in your glutes. There is no exact number of how many sets of squats you should do every day. I train legs three days a week one being a heavy quad day the other being mostly glutehamstring isolation exercises and the last day is a lighter focus with a lot of body weight exercises.
