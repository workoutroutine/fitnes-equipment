<p>If youre doing 10-12 reps make sure its the heaviest weight you can manage for that rep range. Most importantly you will never feel the blood flow and a worked muscle like you do with a set of 50. For example a recent study of resistance-trained young men found that light weight with high reps performed until failure was equally effective in stimulating muscle proteins as a heavy weight.</p>
<h3 id="whats-more-the-fact-that-its-possible-to-build-muscle-using-higher-reps-and-lighter-weights-doesnt-necessarily-mean-that-its-a-good-idea-to-do-so">Whats more the fact that its possible to build muscle using higher reps and lighter weights doesnt necessarily mean that its a good idea to do so.</h3><p>However more strength doesnt always mean bigger muscles and no you arent going to get big and bulky see my previous blog for the reasons why. At the end of 8 weeks researchers found that those who lifted heavier weights with fewer reps had more strength. To burn fat you have to lose weight. However hypertrophy elicited through higher reps and lower weight will. More repetitions with lighter weights can build muscle as well as heavier weights &ndash; assuming they are done to the point of exercise-induced fatigue.</p>

<p>So as some of you might be able to tell it becomes a competition between time under tension versus the amount of repsweight used. Most research points to reps under 15 reps as being better for muscle building but other research shows muscle building can be equally effective with light weight and high reps. Most people believe that the heavier the weight you lift the more the muscle you gain. For example a recent study of resistance-trained young men found that light weight with high reps performed until failure was equally effective in stimulating muscle proteins as a heavy weight.

<p>Well it is not that simple. Remember 3 sets of 25-35 reps was no better than 3 sets of 8-12 reps for building muscle. When getting to a point where people want to focus on strength gains theyd have to almost certainly use heavier weight.
