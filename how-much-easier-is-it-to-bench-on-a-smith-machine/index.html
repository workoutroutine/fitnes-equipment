<p>Due to the lesser amount of muscles required to stabilize the bar as well as the stabilization that the smith machine provides it is most certainly easier to bench with the smith machine. Using a Smith machine doesnt cause any more muscle activation in the anterior delts or pec major. In some cases the Smith machine itself has a counterweight that reduces the weight of the bar and often there is no way to know by how much. The smartest approach is to begin your training on a conventional bench. When you are alone it is much better to either bench press with light-moderate dumbbells light-moderate barbell or as much as you can on a Smith machine.

<p>Because smith machines lead to isolated movements in a 2-D plane of motion they employ fewer muscles than free weights do. The Decline Barbell Bench Press is a compound movement exercise that is a great complimentary exercise to the Smith Machine Press because 1 it targets the lower chest as opposed to the middle chest and 2 as a free weight exercise it utilizes more muscle stabilizers required to balance and control the weight during exercise execution. And for partial. Adjust the incline bench to a 30-45 degree angle. Then adjust the bench under the Smith Machine bar so that it lowers right to where you found the center of your chest will be.

<p>-1 level 1 NateThomas1979 7y edited 7y. Immediate strength gains This ones interesting. Use the smith machine at the end if your workout to get full exhaustion if you wanna use it. While those muscles are still going to get involved its easier to hit the pecs with a smith machine. The difference would be probably around 1020 pounds maybe a bit morebut its not like you will go from 185lbs to 250lbs.

<p>Also knowing the actual weight of the bar is useful for determining your starting weight based on a similar free weight exercise. Free weights generally force a whole host of supporting muscles to work leading to more overall muscle growth. Many Smith machines reduce the bars weight by 10 15 or 20 pounds. The bar path itself is different since you do not move in a straight line despite how it may appear. Due to the lesser amount of muscles required to stabilize the bar as well as the stabilization that the smith machine provides it is most certainly easier to bench with the smith machine.
