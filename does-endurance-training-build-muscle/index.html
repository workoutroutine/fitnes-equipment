While muscle endurance training helps in the development of slow-twitch muscle fibers strength training assists in the development of Fast-twitch muscle fibers. Endurance training does not just build up your muscle mass and strength it also provides unquestionable health benefits improving the overall way your body looks feels and performs. None of that matters for most endurance athletes because your strength and muscle mass are both so low that almost any strength training you do will result in structural and neurological stress and therefore lead to both increased muscle mass and increased strength. Why endurance athletes dont become bodybuilders.</p>
