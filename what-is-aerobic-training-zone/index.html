<p>An endurance athlete should never stop training in zone 2. In the context of a workout this is most often when youve hit close to your maximum heartrate and there isnt enough oxygen getting to your busy body. Lactate inflection point LIP is the exercise intensity at which the blood concentration of lactate andor lactic acid begins to increase rapidly.</p>
<h3 id="the-aerobic-zone-will-help-to-improve-the-bodys-cardiovascular-and-respiratory-systems">The aerobic zone will help to improve the bodys cardiovascular and respiratory systems.</h3><p>Aerobic training should be done at least 3 times a week at an intensity between 70 and 80 of their maximum heart rate and normally goes for 30min in duration. Fartlek training McArdle et. Aerobic exercise stimulates the heart rate and breathing rate to increase in a way that can be sustained for the exercise session. But I wonder how many people really understand how it works. If you can find a training partner with similar goals and fitness level you may be able to train with them but more often I see base work go awry.</p>
