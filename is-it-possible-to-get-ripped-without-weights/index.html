<p>Progressive calisthenics will get you absolutely ripped. Strive to continually beat these times without degrading your technique. One of the greatest substitutes for weight training can be and is bodyweight training. No getting a ripped physique is a process of getting stronger with the exercises overtime which requires a well set up progression model. In fact research shows that low-load resistance training with a light weight or bodyweight combined with little rest may enhance metabolic stress and increase muscle size even more than lifting heavy weights and taking longer breaks.

<p>Youre so right most of my life on gym I was never able to put more muscle mass weight without getting fatter no matter what like without getting a fucking lard belly at 80kg now Im at 73-74kg ectomorph at 176cm height Im probably around 13 body fat right now and if I intend to cut to get to 8 I would definitely be weightening miserables 65-67kg by the end of it just like your. You cant win the battle by focusing on just one thing. It is possible to get ripped without weights. If it wasnt for all the information that you provide I would still be doing a ton of cardio and would still be lifting and eating wrong. Despite the numerous fitness centers and various types of weight equipment available becoming ripped does not require going to a gym or having your own set of weight equipment at home.
