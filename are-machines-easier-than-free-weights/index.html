<p>In general weight machines are a great tool for beginners as they teach proper form and reduce the risk of injury. Using free weights is going to require stricter form and more strength to produce the same motion as a weighted machine if you are using the same weight. Some exercise machines have advantages over free weights either by doing things that free weights cannot do such as leg curls and extensions or by doing them with a better strength curve such as t-bar rows. Thats why free weights are superior. Modern resistance machines on the other hand tend to have many more disadvantages than free weight equipment. Pin On Fitness Tips.</p>
