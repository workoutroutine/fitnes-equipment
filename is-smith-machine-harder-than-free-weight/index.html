<p>Many bodybuilders believe that Smith machine squats with strict form are an equally or even more effective quad builder than free weight squats or at least consider it worth alternating between the two types of squats for variety. The free weight bench press required more activation of the medial deltoid. Researchers from Drake University reported that when 32 trained lifters tested their one-rep max for the Smith machine squat they were about five percent stronger than on the free-weight squat.

<p>Its a little difficult to reconcile this observation with research findings about lesser quad muscle activation. These two muscles worked 34 and 49 percent harder respectively in the free-weight squat. But all I can do to remedy that is deload a little and make sure elbows are pointed down when I use barbell. This was not found in the study. I also have my reasons for believing it is worse than free weights for pretty much all exercises. Smith Machine Bench Press Vs Barbell Bench Press.</p>
