<p>Resistance is your best friend when it comes to the elliptical so once you get familiar with it be generous with it. Low resistance should be 40 to 50 percent of your maximum effort moderate resistance should be 60 to 70 percent and high resistance should feel like 80 to 90 percent. At a constant running speed the higher the level of resistance the more difficult it will be to pedal and the more energy you will expend. It requires your body to overcome an opposing force. The American Council on Exercise suggests aiming for a combination of speed resistance and ramp height increases on an elliptical to reach maximum effort for high-intensity interval training HIIT.
