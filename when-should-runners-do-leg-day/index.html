<p><strong>When Should Runners Do Leg Day</strong>, Tieri also recommends runners start with bodyweight exercises that focus on eccentric loading to build strength during the lengthening phase. Running primarily works the calf and shin muscles. Should you be running your lungs off on SERIOUS inclines then I would say yes it can account as leg day but only when running very hard for many hard miles.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="100%" src="https://workoutroutine.github.io/img/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/46/b9/5f/46b95f96ca144fea87af65700da43f83.jpg" alt="Pin On The Best Leg Workouts" title="Pin On The Best Leg Workouts" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https:\/\/workoutroutine.github.io\/img\/placeholder.svg';" class="center" />

<p>Ideally try and get a run in the day after you work the leg muscles with a serious leg day and your body will thank you for it. If you cant avoid lifting and running on the same day leave 12. Their legs often feel heavy in the first few miles but by the end of the run their legs feel full of pop.</p>
<h3 id="even-if-you-only-have-1-day-a-week-to-lift">Even if you only have 1 day a week to lift.</h3><p>Stronger muscles also provide stability to joints which means less wear and tear on ligaments and tendons. If you still choose to do so at least keep the intensity of your leg workout as low as possible as to keep the stress your muscle have to endure in check. Dont do strength training on the same day as a hard run. Then when you do run you should still take it at a low to moderate intensity. My leg day is squats deadlifts barbell hip thrusts and either glute kickbacks or weighted reverse hypers.</p>
