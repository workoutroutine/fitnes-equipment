<p>Answer 1 of 2. Why do wrestlers wear a black ring. Weight class matches in modern-day American professional wrestling are rare but weight class championships still exist.

On average a sumo wrestler weighs around 325 pounds 1474 kg. The garment can weigh more than eight pounds and be up to 2 feet wide before it is wrapped around the sumo wrestler. A wrestler who loses more than 15 of their alpha body weight in a week is ineligible to compete in the weight class to which they are descending.
