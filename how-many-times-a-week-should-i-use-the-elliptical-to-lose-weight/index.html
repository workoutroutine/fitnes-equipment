According to research a person weighing 70 kg or 15432 pounds will burn 88 calories doing elliptical exercise for 15 minutes source. But if desired you can also exercise for more than five days. To lose weight at a rate of 2 pounds per week youll need to burn 7000 calories per week since 3500 calories is equal to 1 pound of body weight. I use the elliptical about 40 minutes 5-6 times a week at the gym. Pin On Ganar Masa Muscular.</p>
