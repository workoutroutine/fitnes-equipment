Its very common for women to get a puffy appearance when theyre not well hydrated. 3 square meals a day then it will remain large enough to hold that capacity but stomachs will grow and shrink depending on what they need to hold so if you start eating say 5 smaller meals a day it is likely that your stomach itself will shrink and therefore MAY protrude less when relaxed.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-mean-by-holding-your-stomach">What do mean by holding your stomach.</h3><p>If you need to use the bathroom but you hold it in youre actually sending your body a signal that it cant. The abdominal muscles are connected to the pelvic floor as well as the diaphragm and so overly tight abs can affect pelvic floor function. If you stand up and try it right now youll notice that you instantly feel taller. In reality if you hold any muscle in the same position for too long it actually weakens. This may lead to more serious conditions such as colon damage resulting from the effort and strain of excreting it later on.</p>
