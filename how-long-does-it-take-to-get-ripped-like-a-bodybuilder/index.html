<p>It all depends on how ripped you want to be. Ive been bodybuilding for a little over 10 years. Figure out what macro ratios work for you. 2500 cal is enough if you are an easy gainer and your not very active. You dont need to be so worried about how many calories that your taking in.

How much exercise you need to get ripped depends on many factors including your current body-fat percentage your diet and genetics. It took me 2 years to get my six pack abs but people had started complimenting my physique when I was only 5 weeks into my training. To avoid this cancel. For the 2nd picture I would say one year more or less its all about your drive and how bad you want it to be able to stay precisely consistent.
