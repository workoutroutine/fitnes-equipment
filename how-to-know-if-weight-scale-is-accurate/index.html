<p>Its a non-digital upright scale and looks very old. For example if you have a 10-pound dumbbell put it on the bathroom scale. If it is it might be that your scale is always off by that amount.</p>
<h3 id="then-add-two-more-pennies-and-note-the-weight-between-the-two-pennies">Then add two more pennies and note the weight between the two pennies.</h3><p>Test if your scale is accurate by finding an item with an exact weight for example a 10-pound free weight. Placing the scale on carpeting or a slant will cause the pressure on the four sensors in the corner of the scale to be uneven and the reading. First of all turn the machine and make sure that it is at zero. Give it several seconds to weigh and check out the final weight. If it matches the scale is accurate.</p>

<p>When you step on the scale your weight is evenly distributed across the surface and you press down on the strain gauge. Repeat this for at least five times to ensure that the scale is consistent over several weighing. If the scale registers anything other than 10 pounds it needs to be calibrated or replaced. If the scale is moved and you do NOT calibrate it you are likely to see fluctuations in your weight. Im doubting its accuracy from looking at it and Ive never seen anyone actually use it.
