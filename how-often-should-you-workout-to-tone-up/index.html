<p>When you go right to the weights you have all the energy you need to lift as hard as you want. Similar to the burpee challenge youll fall into your rhythm in week 2 and feel challenged by week 3. Or try this 30-day push-up challenge which will coach you through it. Warming up before a workout is important to prevent injury while exercising and to gradually increase your heart rate. If followed correctly you should start seeing and feeling noticeable improvements on a weekly basis. Pin On Health Fitness.</p>
