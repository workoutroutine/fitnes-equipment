<p>Keep in mind that any guest brought needs to have a photo ID with them. Well there are the weights used to crush chests during the Salem Witch Trials but thats just a good reason to keep exercise equipment away from religious fanatics. Headphones are a must if you want to watch any of our TVs while doing cardio. In addition to extensive and frequent cleaning by Planet Fitness teams weve installed new Sanitizing stations as well as sanitizer on every piece of equipment so that you can clean equipment yourself before and after use for added peace of mind. If you do not comply we can at our own discretion deny access cancel memberships or ask you to leave the premises.
