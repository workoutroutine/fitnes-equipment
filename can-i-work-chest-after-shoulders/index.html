<p>But if benching hurts your shoulders you train at home without a trusty spotter or youve found that barbell training just doesnt give you a bigger chest dumbbell work is the answer. The pectoralis minor is pretty difficult to rub yourself but firm massage in the upper. You can challenge your shoulders with pretty much any plank move.</p>
<h3 id="both-of-those-approaches-can-work-quite-well">Both of those approaches can work quite well.</h3><p>Youll either be doing high-frequency training or using a body-part split.

The dumbbell bench is one of the best exercises you can do to build your chest at home in the absence of a barbell. The cause of chest pain can range from mild to severe ones that require immediate medical attention.</p>
