Toning your muscles is a great goal to have but if you have a lot of fat covering up those muscles its going to take a lot longer for you to get that toned appearance. Rowing does cause a good deal of contraction in your abdominal muscles and because of that you can definitely get a good workout in. Start with short light rowing workouts and focus on back posture and flexing in the upper back to build the necessary back leg and abdomen strength required to row properly. The regular and systematic use of the rowing machine ensures a toned stomach and perfect abs. The Transformative Total Body Rowing Machine Workout Shape Magazine.</p>

Im planning on spending at least 25 minutes 5 days a week on my rowing machine. I have been using a rowing machine as part of my gym routine however I have been finding conflicting answers to what you will actually benefit from using it. Although rowing wont magically spot reduce your belly fat it can be a very effective component of a fat-loss program that will with a bit of time slim you down everywhere.
