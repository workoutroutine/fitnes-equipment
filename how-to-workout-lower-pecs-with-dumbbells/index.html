<p>As with all flys keep your arms locked into position with a slight bend and squeeze your pecs to move the dumbbell up rather than just your arms and lower down slowly to really feel the stretch. Next lay down in a perpendicular manner on the bench while keeping your feet on the ground. Or even better have a spotter hand them to. The external rotation of the shoulders is what stretches your pecs minor. Lie back on a flat exercise bench holding two heavy dumbbells on your chest palms facing one another.

Pause and reverse the movement under control to bring the weights back up to the starting position. Hold a single dumbbell in both hands. Set the angle on an adjustable bench to 15 degrees.
