<p>Nor am I saying that you should forego those lifts altogether. By squatting you increase the bodys metabolic rate and are able to burn more calories over a longer period of time compared with other cardiovascular activities. Dont do overhead squats as a separate exercise. By squatting everyday using proper squat form a beginner trainee can reverse the effects of this natural decline by building muscle mass for overall strength and power. But you need to work up to that level of work capacity first. Pin On Sport And Exercise.</p>
