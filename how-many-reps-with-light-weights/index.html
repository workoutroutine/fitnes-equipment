<p>Hell if some guy at the gym laughs at you for doing such high reps at light weight beg him to try the Power of 50. For strength you typically do 3-5 sets of 3-6 reps with heavier weight. No shit thanks bro. Aim for 8-12 reps at 70-75 of your one-rep lifting capacity. For any exercise pick a weight that you can only lift for 6 reps.

<p>Person 1 then goes over picks up the 20 pounds dumbbells and starts banging out 20 rep sets of bicep curls with the ferocity of an unburdened mind. If you dont want your muscles to tear just dont push it as hard. In trying to clarify which is better between the two options a research carried out to check the effectiveness of lighter weights and heavier weights when trying to gain muscle and build strength found out that lifting light weights for about 20 to 25 times is as effective in building muscle size and strength just as when a person lifts heavier weights for about 8 to 12 times 12. Phillips and his team found that muscle protein synthesis a key driving force behind muscle growth was higher with light weights and high reps 4 sets of 24 reps than it was with heavier weights and lower reps 4 sets of 5 reps. But lifting light weights like a little pussy isnt going to make that happen. Pin On Fitness.</p>
