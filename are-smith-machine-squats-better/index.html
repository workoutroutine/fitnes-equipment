<p>The Smith machine is good for those that KNOW HOW to use it safelyno excessive foot positions BUT THE FREE SQUAT IS BETTER if you can squat safely. The Smith Squat helps balance the weight for you and so performing the exercise becomes easier and less strength is required overall. Its tough to assert which is better between the smith machine and dumbbell squats. Alternate between these versions of the squat from workout to workout or perform barbell squats first in your leg workout and follow them with the Smith machine version after barbell squats. Many people consider the smith machine to be the best for glute exercises because its so versatile. Hack Squat Vs Squat Squats Squats Video Barbell Hack Squat.</p>
