<p>Doing ultrasounds for estimating fetal weight is a very questionable policy but many providers routinely do it anyhow. For me i was in the hospital for 6 weeks because my water broke at 28 weeks. But unlike weighing the baby on a scale after birth even the best ultrasound measurements arent 100 reliable. The estimation of fetal weight by ultrasound is routinely used in clinical practice. Your baby will be measured to calculate their EFW at 18-22 weeks during your anatomical ultrasound and this helps your healthcare provider determine if your baby is growing along the growth curve appropriately.
