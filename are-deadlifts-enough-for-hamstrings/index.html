<p>This is why its crucial to get the form nailed down your lower back is easily injured. But this is nowhere near enough to stimulate any sort of muscle growth. It will thus help with development of the hamstrings which comprise the posterior chain of muscles however to really stimulate muscle growth in the quads focus on. The compound movements above will also target the glutes effectively and a hip thrusting exercise will train the glutes harder than any exercise out there.

And one exercise where movement is focused at the knee joint like the leg curl glute-ham raise or other isolation exercises. Pin On Glutes.</p>
