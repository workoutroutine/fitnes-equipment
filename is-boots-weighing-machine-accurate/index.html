<p>Start date 6 November 2010. I will say go for Digital weight machine or Digital weight scale. In addition scales can be accurate at low weights so u put a 12kg kettle bell on and it is accurate but at higher weights it can be out my dad sells things for gardening in 100 weights and he has to have the scale calibrated at higher weights to be legal. And the fat isnt accurate. I dont think they can be that accurate from a shop floor the only thing that would be reliable would be weight. Pin On Exercise Get Healthy.</p>

<p>How accurate are the weighing machines in boots. Home Uncategorised how accurate are the weighing machines in boots. Moreover the analog machines cant be expected to give an accurate measurement of the item over various attempts rather it fluctuates. I will say go for Digital weight machine or Digital weight scale. If all 3 say roughly the same thing then you can assume they are reasonably accurate assuming you are not an athlete or a bodybuilder.

<p>How accurate are the weighing machines in boots. Last time I got measured I was 5 69 which was on October 31st. I use the Boots machine and it has been fine for me so far. In addition scales can be accurate at low weights so u put a 12kg kettle bell on and it is accurate but at higher weights it can be out my dad sells things for gardening in 100 weights and he has to have the scale calibrated at higher weights to be legal.
