Your thighs become slim due to the calorie loss that happens during the aerobic exercise process. Celebrity fitness trainer Tracy Anderson cautions that too much cycling can bulk up the thighs rather than slim them down. The bottom line is stationary biking will make your thighs smaller not larger over time if you keep the resistance low and workout consistently. If running makes your legs bigger it is not a problem that makes you anxious. Embracing Strong Legs How Cycling Does Doesn T Change A Woman S Body We Love Cycling Magazine.</p>

<p>So try not to evaluate your training process based on whether you have a big leg. Creating more lean muscle mass in your thighs particularly the large front muscles of the quadriceps may help you lose more fat overall. The short answer for whether or not cycling is going to make your legs huge is no. It might seem counter-intuitive to hold onto your muscle mass if your goal is to make your thighs thinner. However since your muscles burn calories they can actually help you burn fat over time. Embracing Strong Legs How Cycling Does Doesn T Change A Woman S Body We Love Cycling Magazine.</p>
