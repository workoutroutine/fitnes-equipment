<p>A lot of dumb answers on here talk about weight training. Another big benefit that weight training has over cardio training is that it will allow you to completely reshape your body. A general rule of thumb to keep in mind is that strength training helps to change your shape while cardio helps to change your size. In theory the way strength training forces your body to use more energy after your time at the gym should balance if not edge out cardio fasted or not in terms of total calories burned. Its more of an explosive fine-tuned movement whereas cardio is generally longer and more steady and doesnt require the quick bursts says Burke.
