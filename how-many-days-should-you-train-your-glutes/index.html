<p>So Monday-Thursday would be good days to workout same muscle. I train legs three days a week one being a heavy quad day the other being mostly glutehamstring isolation exercises and the last day is a lighter focus with a lot of body weight exercises. Training the glutes will really help you along in making the rest of your body stronger. Hopefully this helps and good luck. The short answer is 2-6 times per week. 4 821 Likes 22 Comments Mahesh Fitness Coach Fitfundamahesh On Instagram How Often Workout Program Gym Abs Workout Gym Full Body Workout Routine.</p>
