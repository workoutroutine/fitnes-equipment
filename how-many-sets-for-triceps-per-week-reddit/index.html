<p>I dont train calves cause my calves are already huge from tae kwan do training. They supposedly trained to momentary muscle failure but you know the face I make when researchers proudly claim their moderately trained subjects all did 16 sets of squats to true failure per week. ONCE a week will do 4-5 sets of varied curls as long as you are doing a back workout during the week. In my opinion your arms should be the last worry I mean they grow a little bit slow so take your time do 6-12 sets per one arm muscle eat a lot and it should be fine. The momentary failure part I highly doubt as the idea even a highly trained athlete could perform 8 sets of squats of 8 10 reps each to failure as they did in the study is suspect at best.

<p>The momentary failure part I highly doubt as the idea even a highly trained athlete could perform 8 sets of squats of 8 10 reps each to failure as they did in the study is suspect at best. I run a abcxabxcxabc routine x is break level 2. Dont overwork your triceps as they get worked by several different muscle groups. Biceps 1 exercise 6 sets of 18-20 Triceps 1 exercise 6 sets of 18-20 So I guess 3 exercise each per week 14 sets. While doing two sets of each triceps exercise in your training routine is sufficient to realize. Thoughts R Nattyorjuice.</p>

<p>4 sets 12 reps 48 total. With this workout routine youre training your triceps 3 times per week and two of those workouts train them quite hard. Rest at least four days between the two Tricep workouts to recover before you go at it again. Biceps 1 exercise 6 sets of 18-20 Triceps 1 exercise 6 sets of 18-20 So I guess 3 exercise each per week 14 sets. How Many Sets Should You Do.
