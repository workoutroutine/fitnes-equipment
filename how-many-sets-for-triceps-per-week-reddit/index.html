<p>Merkava has some good advice. 4-5 sets bench 3-4 sets chest press 3 sets flys.

Take arms as an example. Performing as little as 6-8 sets per week can also suffice for some lifters who are performing a lot of pressing as the triceps are also responsible for this movement.

<p>I dont train calves cause my calves are already huge from tae kwan do training. They supposedly trained to momentary muscle failure but you know the face I make when researchers proudly claim their moderately trained subjects all did 16 sets of squats to true failure per week. ONCE a week will do 4-5 sets of varied curls as long as you are doing a back workout during the week. In my opinion your arms should be the last worry I mean they grow a little bit slow so take your time do 6-12 sets per one arm muscle eat a lot and it should be fine. The momentary failure part I highly doubt as the idea even a highly trained athlete could perform 8 sets of squats of 8 10 reps each to failure as they did in the study is suspect at best.

I run a abcxabxcxabc routine x is break level 2. Dont overwork your triceps as they get worked by several different muscle groups. Biceps 1 exercise 6 sets of 18-20 Triceps 1 exercise 6 sets of 18-20 So I guess 3 exercise each per week 14 sets. While doing two sets of each triceps exercise in your training routine is sufficient to realize. Thoughts R Nattyorjuice.</p>

Rest at least four days between the two Tricep workouts to recover before you go at it again.
