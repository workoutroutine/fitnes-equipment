<p><strong>Does Resistance Training Increase Muscle Size</strong>, Because this muscular enlargement is achieved by the addition of structural proteins athletes trying to build muscle mass often ingest large amounts of protein. C ompared with endurance exercise resistance exercise consists of much higher intensity contractions eg usually 70 to 80 of one repetition maximum repeated at high frequencies referring again to motoneuron firing frequency that can only be sustained for short durations due to the fatiguing nature of the exercise. A large portion of the low-load resistance training literature finds similar increases in muscle size as high-load resistance training but lower levels of strength in these exercises.</p>
