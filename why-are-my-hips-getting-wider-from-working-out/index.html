<p>I also think I got wider as in my hips and ribs spread a little more my stomach is flatter than its ever been but Im still in the 130-140 range like I was in high school and I think my feet grew a little. There will be a period of time where your body has both this newly formed muscle AND fat. My hips and butt started growing out of nowhere when I hit 20 and I no longer look top heavy at all. Youll be less likely to need a C-section ifwhen you have kids than someone with a narrower pelvic girdle. You will have big thighs because they are an extension of your hips. 10 Minute Tiny Waist Wider Hips Workout Lean Curves Femniqe Hip Workout Wide Hip Workouts Tiny Waist.</p>

<p>A client of ours by the name of Dale saw us a few months ago. My hips and butt started growing out of nowhere when I hit 20 and I no longer look top heavy at all. The hormone Relaxin is released by the body to help relax pelvic joints and ligaments. Long story short - This is because when you start working out you dont have much muscle mass. Dale was struggling with hip tightness for years. Pin On Butt.</p>
