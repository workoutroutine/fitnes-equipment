<p>If you are a true ectomorph heavy weight lifting will make you toned and its very unlikely that it will make you bulky. As a general rule lifting doesnt make your legs beefy Instead it typically has the opposite effect. You cant go for just one heavy-lifting session and hope to come out looking bigger and feeling stronger. If you are eating too much your legs will look big anyways and even bigger because you build up muscle under the fat layer and that will make your legs look bigger eventually. Believe it or not ankle weights can help take your abdominal workouts to the next level. Pin On Workout.</p>
