<p>If you dont think there isnt a resistance band man enough for youthink again. Just make sure you dont overstretch yourself. Resistance bands produce little resistance until it is stretched. Buy the required amount of spandex in your favourite colour and use a zig-zag stitch to sew the ends together. You can prevent the bands from rolling up by getting resistance bands with the right width and length. Stop Your Belus Resistance Bands From Rolling Once And For All.</p>
