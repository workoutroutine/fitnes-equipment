<p>ANY doctor who skews the scales weight deliberately is doing a VERY bad thing and should be reprimanded. New scales can be wrong. Anyone can be wrong on anything. I weighed at home this morning. In fact I believe there are several reasons. Pin On Humor.</p>

<p>You can test if your scale is consistent by weighing the same item that you know wont change weight I used a water jug my first time and then weighing it again a day later. It also includes your father uncle and friends. Calm down theres a perfectly logical reason why youre doctors scale weighed you 17 pounds heavier than youre scale. Do a test with an object of known weight to see which one is accurate. But its also likely that the difference is water weight because of when you are weighing. Pin On Heart For Health.</p>
