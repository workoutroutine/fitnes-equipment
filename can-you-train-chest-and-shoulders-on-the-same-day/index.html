<p>It might work for you&ndash;or it might not depending on your specific training level and needs. I devote an entire day to chest and abs and really feel like the extra attention has made a noticeable difference. Yes a chest press primarily pounds your pectorals but it also works your shoulders and triceps at the same time. Your triceps are a much smaller muscle group that doesnt take as long to recover and that doesnt require big compound movements to grow. Also simply arrange your workout in a way that those other pushing muscles are completed after your chest session never before. The Community Shoulder Gym Gym Workouts Chest And Shoulder Workout.</p>

<p>If you are a real die-hard with some experience under your belt you could do the different training sessions back to back one each day. Also simply arrange your workout in a way that those other pushing muscles are completed after your chest session never before. If you train chest andor triceps the same day as delts youre fine. My chest and shoulders the same day the muscle groups you should train on chest biceps shoulders legs back you train shoulders after chest day. Then on delttricep day I start with OHP and then isolate my triceps and have noticed my arms have definitely gotten larger since giving my tris the extra attention.

<p>Since the chest and shoulders work together they should be trained 48 hours apart. They train legs and shoulders and back and biceps and triceps and all the rest on the same day. Both Chest and shoulders are considered as Push muscles. Lots of people train with full-body routines. Dont think of training chest and back together as doing a chest workout followed by a back workout.
