<p><strong>Are Cable Weights Effective</strong>, They can get your blood flowing to your joints and muscles and your body temperature up just like free weights PLUS they can also be used for mobility exercises to make sure your range of motion is. Disadvantages to Bowflex The main disadvantage to systems that provide resistance via cables &ndash; including Bowflex machines &ndash; is that fewer supporting muscles are required in any given exercise.
